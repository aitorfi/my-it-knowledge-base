# File Storage

@see [Laravel File Storage docs](https://laravel.com/docs/master/filesystem)

## How to store and access files

The `public` disk included in your application's `filesystems` configuration file is intended for files that are going to be publicly accessible. By default, the `public` disk uses the `local` driver and stores its files in `storage/app/public`.

To make these files accessible from the web, you should create a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`. Symbolic links are configured in `/config/filesystems.php`, to create the symlinks run the command `php artisan storage:link`, note that if you are running the application inside a container the command must be run from inside the container otherwise the link will be broken.

### Code example on how to store an image

#### File System configuration file
```php
<?php

return [
	...
	
	'links' => [
		public_path('storage') => storage_path('app/public'),
	],
];
```

#### Route
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\ImageController;

Route::group([
	"prefix" => "image",
	"controller" => ImageController::class],
	function() {
		Route::post(
			'',
			'create'
		)->name('createImage');
		
		Route::delete(
			'{id}',
			'delete'
		)->name('deleteImage');
	}
);
```
#### Controller
```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;

use App\Models\Image;

class ImageController extends Controller
{
	public function create(Request $request): JsonResponse
	{
		// Stores the image in storage/app/public/images/
		// $path will be equal to "images/<image-name>"
		$path = $request->file('image')->store('images', 'public');
		// Get the url at which the image can be publicly accessed
		// (in the public/storage directory where the symlink to
		// storage/app/public was created)
		$url = asset('storage/'.$imagePath);

		// Insert an image record in the DB.
		$image = Image::create([
			'path' => $path,
			'url' => $url
		]);

		return response()->json($image, Response::HTTP_CREATED);
	}

	public function delete(Image $image): JsonResponse
	{
		$path = storage_path('app/public/').$image->path;
		
		$image->delete(); // Delete the image record from the DB.
		
		if (file_exists($path))
			unlink($path); // Delete the file.
		
		return response()->json(null, Response::HTTP_NO_CONTENT);
	}
}
```
